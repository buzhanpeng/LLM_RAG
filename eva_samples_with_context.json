    "answer": "Blore thinks that Rogers and his wife had committed a murder together and got away with it. But last night someone leaked the secret, and his wife might confess out of fear. This was a threat to Rogers. For his own safety, he couldn't let his wife have the chance to confess, so he put drugs in her tea to make her shut up forever.",
    "context": "Blore said: “And there's the position for you! They've done a murder and got away with it. But if the whole thing's going to be raked up, what's going to happen? Ten to one, the woman will give the show away. She hasn't got the nerve to stand up and brazen it out. She's a living danger to her husband, that's what she is. He's all right. He'll lie with a straight face till kingdom comes but he can't be sure of her! And if she goes to pieces, his neck's in danger! So he slips something into a cup of tea and makes sure that her mouth is shut permanently."

He definitely presided over the court. Clearing his throat, he once more spoke. 'This morning, gentlemen, whilst I was sitting on the terrace. I was an observer of your activities. There could be little doubt of your purpose. You were searching the island for an unknown murderer?'"

This may have eventually made his head swell, and he wants to go one step further and become an executioner and a special judge.",
    "context": "Philip Lombard said: 'Hard to say exactly. But to begin with, he's an old man and he's been presiding over courts of law for years. That is to say, he's played God Almighty for a good many months every year. That must go to a man's head eventually. He gets to see himself as all powerful, as holding the power of life and death and it's possible that his brain might snap and he might want to go one step farther and be Executioner and Judge Extraordinary.'"

    {
    "query": "Who does Vera speculate the murderer might be and what is the reason?",
    "answer": "Vera thinks that the murderer might be Dr. Armstrong. The reasons are that there have been two deaths caused by poisoning, which points to the doctor. Also, the sleeping pills that Mrs. Rogers took were given by him. At the same time, if a doctor goes crazy, it is not easy to be detected, and doctors are overworked and under great pressure.",
    "context": "Vera said without any hesitation: 'Dr. Armstrong.' Lombard gave a low whistle. 'The doctor, eh? You know, I should have put him last of all.' Vera shook her head. 'Oh, no! Two of the deaths have been poison. That rather points to a doctor. And then you can't get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain Mrs. Rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave her.' Vera persisted: 'If a doctor went mad, it would be a long time before any one suspected. And doctors overwork and have a lot of strain.'"

What the devil do you mean, Rogers?' 'It's gone, sir, clean vanished. I was going round drawing all the curtains and the one in the lav bathroom wasn't there any longer.'

    {
    "query": "What safety measures did everyone take when they went to bed at night?",
    "answer": "When going to bed at night, the ladies locked the doors and bolted them after entering their rooms. The gentlemen also locked their doors. Blore also suggested putting a chair under the doorknob because someone could turn the lock from the outside. Rogers also locked the door of his own room and bolted it. He also locked the door of the dining room leading to the pantry and the door leading to the hall and took the key away.",
    "context": "Vera said: 'I'll go to bed too.' The two women went up the stairs and Lombard and Blore went with them. Standing at the top of the stairs, the two men watched the women go into their respective rooms and shut the doors. They heard the sound of two bolts being shot and the turning of two keys. Blore said with a grin: 'No need to tell 'em to lock their doors!' Lombard said: 'Well, they're all right for the night, at any rate!' He went down again and the other followed him. and The judge's voice spoke: 'I need hardly advise you, gentlemen, to lock your doors.' Blore said: 'And, what's more, put a chair under the handle. There are ways of turning locks from the outside.' and Rogers came out of the dining room and slipped halfway up the stairs. He saw four figures pass through four doors and heard the turning of four locks and the shooting of four bolts. He nodded his head. 'That's all right,' he muttered. He went back into the dining room. Yes, everything was ready for the morning. His eye lingered on the centre plaque of looking glass and the seven little china figures. A sudden grin transformed his face. He murmured: 'I'll see no one plays tricks tonight, at any rate.' Crossing the room he locked the door to the pantry. Then going through the other door to the hall he pulled the door to, locked it and slipped the key into his pocket. Then, extinguishing the lights, he hurried up the stairs and into his new bedroom. There was only one possible hiding place in it, the tall wardrobe, and he looked into that immediately. Then, locking and bolting the door, he prepared for bed."

There was no water boiling in the kitchen, and the fire was not lit either. Moreover, the little Chinese porcelain figures on the dining table had decreased from seven to six.",
    "context": "Philip Lombard said: 'Anybody called you or brought you any tea? Do you know what time it is?' Blore said: 'Twenty-five to ten. Wouldn't have believed I could have slept like that. Where's Rogers?' Philip Lombard said: 'It's a case of echo answers where?' and Lombard said: 'He might have done that last night.' They all moved inside the room, looking at the neatly set plates and cutlery. At the row of cups on the sideboard. At the felt mats placed ready for the coffee urn. It was Vera who saw it first. She caught the judge's arm and the grip of her athletic fingers made the old gentleman wince. She cried out: 'The Indians! Look!' There were only six china figures in the middle of the table."

    {
    "query": "Where was Rogers' body found and what was the cause of his death?",
    "answer": "Rogers' body was found in the small laundry across the yard. The cause of his death was that the murderer crept up behind him when he was bending over to chop wood for starting the fire and struck his head violently with a large axe. There was a deep wound on his head, and the metal part of the large axe, which was the murder weapon, had a dull brown bloodstain.",
    "context": "They found him shortly afterwards. He was in the little washhouse across the yard. He had been chopping sticks in preparation for lighting the kitchen fire. The small chopper was still in his hand. A bigger chopper, a heavy affair, was leaning against the door the metal of it stained a dull brown. It corresponded only too well with the deep wound in the back of Rogers' head... and Armstrong. 'The murderer must have crept up behind him, swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending over.'"
